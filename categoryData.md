Users entrust developers with their data. To earn and maintain their trust, we must employ security controls that protect data from unauthorized access. Confidentiality is one of three essential elements of Information Security, also known as the CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability).

To protect data developers must employ best practices such as:
- Using one way salted hashes with multiple iterations to store passwords
- Securing transmission of data using latest TLS protocols and strongest ciphers
- Encrypting data at rest using the strongest cryptographic algorithm and keys.
- Storing encryption keys to a restricted KMS
